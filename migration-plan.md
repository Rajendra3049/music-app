# Migration Plan: DJ VM Vishal Music Website Restructuring

This document outlines the step-by-step process to migrate the current project structure to the new feature-based architecture defined in `directory.md`. The migration will be executed in phases to ensure no functionality is broken during the process.

## Migration Principles

1. **Incremental Approach**: Migrate one feature at a time
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing imports during transition
3. **Testing Checkpoints**: Verify functionality after each phase
4. **No Feature Changes**: Focus solely on restructuring, not modifying functionality

## Phase 0: Preparation

### 0.2 Setup Migration Tools
- [ ] Create shell scripts for automated file moving (if needed)
- [ ] Setup path alias in tsconfig.json to support new directory structure
```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"],
      "@features/*": ["./src/features/*"],
      "@shared/*": ["./src/shared/*"],
      "@data/*": ["./src/data/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 0.3 Create New Directory Structure
- [ ] Create empty directories according to the structure in directory.md
```bash
mkdir -p src/features/{audio,music,video,three}/{components,hooks,types,utils}
mkdir -p src/shared/{components/{ui,layout,providers},config,constants,hooks,lib,services,types}
mkdir -p src/data
```

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during migration:

1. Identify the problematic phase
2. Revert to the last stable commit before that phase
3. Fix identified issues
4. Re-attempt the migration phase with fixes applied

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 0 (Preparation)**: 1 day
- **Phase 1 (Shared Resources)**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2 (Data Layer)**: 1 day
- **Phase 3-6 (Feature Migrations)**: 2 days per feature (8 days total)
- **Phase 7 (Pages Refactoring)**: 2 days
- **Phase 8 (Clean-up)**: 2 days

Total estimated time: **16-17 days**

## Progress Tracking

Create a tracking document or use GitHub project board to track migration progress:

- Track completion of each task
- Document issues encountered
- Record time spent on each phase
- Note any deviations from the plan

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to reorganize the codebase without disrupting functionality. By following this incremental process, we can safely transform the project into a more maintainable and scalable architecture.

The feature-based organization will make the codebase easier to navigate, improve code reusability, and enhance team collaboration on future development efforts.
